                   <article>
                   <p>The classic defination of art is,it is the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination,
 typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, 
producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power.<p> <b>OR</b><p>Arts refer to paintings, architecture, literature, music, dance, languages and cinema. 
In early India, most of the arts were derived Vedic influences. After the birth of contemporary Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism arts flourished under the patronage of kings and emperors. </p>

                       <p>Although there has been much speculation regarding the definition of art over the years, there is a general consensus that there are seven main kinds of art,

                   <article>
                             <h4><b>Painting:</b></h4>
                       <p>Painting is one of the oldest kinds of art, dating back tens of thousands of years,
 and is evident on caves at various sites across the world, such as the Drakensberg in South Africa, the Northern Territory in Australia, 
and the Lascaux paintings in France to name only three of many sacred sites that are scattered across the globe. Some of these sites have become designated 
world heritage sites to preserve cultural history associated with those areas,
 and to preserve them.</p>
<code>Painting is the application of paint, usually on a two-dimensional surface.</code>
  
                            <h4><b>Sculpture:</b></h4>
                      <p>Sculpture is another ancient art form, dating back to some of the earliest civilizations. Unlike painting though, 
this form of art involves the creation of art in the three dimensions.
 The type of material used can be anything natural or artificial – from clay,
 metal, and wood to objects that artists come across in their everyday lives.
</p>

<code>Different processes can be used in creating sculptures, such as modeling, casting, assembling, and carving.</code>
      <h4><b>Architecture:</b></h4>
<p>People often identify architecture as going back to the very first structures that people built as dwellings. If we are to define architecture in this way, we can think of the teepee in America or the yurt in Mongolia. Some architecture has a distinct aesthetic quality though – indeed, the relationship between utility and beauty is sometimes central in architectural design as it is in other forms of art.
</p>
<code>Looking back, some of the most exquisite examples of architecture still boggle the mind.</code>

 <h4><b>Literature:</b></h4>
<p>The word “literature” is derived from the Latin word that is translated as “letters” and refers to the written word in particular. Language is a powerful and symbolic way of communicating, and writing is no exception. The earliest texts date back thousands of years to Mesopotamia, although it is thought that writing developed independently on different continents.
</p>
<code>The first piece of literature with an identifiable author was some of the prayers written by the priestess Ur in Sumeria in Mesopotamia.</code>
 <h4><b>Music:</b></h4>
<p>Music is created when there is an organization of sounds, as vibrations, that are put together to form an audible composition. Elements of a musical composition include harmony, timbre, melody, and rhythm. Although the presence of music in ancient civilization is harder to trace than visual art, remains of musical instruments have been found that are thousands of years old.
</p>
<code>Music and sound created by the voice and/or instruments have played an important role in various cultures on all continents of the globe making it a universal feature of humanity.</code>
 <h4><b>Cinema:</b></h4>
<p>Relative to the other art types discussed in this article, cinema is a fairly recent form of art. Instead of attributing the development of cinema to one inventor, many great minds contributed to the entrance of cinema into people’s lives as is the case with many great inventions and discoveries of our time.
</p>
<code>Cinema first took the form of a “kinetoscope” in 1893, which was a contraption that enabled one person to see the motion picture at a time. The first public show was made in 1895 in Paris.</code>
 <h4><b>Theater:</b></h4>
<p>Theater is a performance art that usually includes a visual element that has been used for entertainment purposes for thousands of years. One of the most famous locations central to bringing Romans together for entertainment was the Colosseum which, although now in ruins, remains a testimony to the flourishing culture of the Roman Empire. Indeed, Rome in the 6th century BCE is seen as the earliest example of theater in the “western world”.
</p>
<code>Theater can take several forms such as puppetry, dance, circuses, magic shows, or plays.

                       <p>Art is all around us. Whether you hear your favorite song on the radio or drive by a gorgeous mural, you experience art every day. We know that these meeting points elevate our everyday experiences, but it’s common to lose sight of the overall impact of the arts on communities.
</p>
<p>Our goal here is to dive into this topic and answer that question: “Why is art important?” By answering it with insights from research, we hope to provide studio owners and teachers alike with the solid information they need to share their love of the arts with their wider communities.
</p>      

<li><b> It promotes expression and creativity</b></li>
<p>As humans, we’re naturally drawn to art as a form of expression and communication. Toddlers love to draw, sing, and dance. It’s a way for them to express themselves before they’re verbal.
</p>
<p>In fact, participation in the arts may even assist kids with language, motor skills, and visual learning development. Research indicates that young people who regularly participate in the arts are four times more likely to be recognized for academic achievement later on.
</p>
<li><b> It helps all of us develop necessary soft skills</li></b>
<p>The importance of art in society goes far beyond what we do in our free time. It can also help people work better.
</p>
<p>When someone applies for a job, there are certain hard skills they need to have like data analysis or bookkeeping. However, many employers also understand the very important need for soft skills. These intangible attributes are hard to measure and often difficult to define. Some examples include a person’s ability to adapt to change, think creatively, or collaborate with team members.
</p>

<li><b>It provides historical context</li></b>
<p>Art and human history go hand-in-hand. This is why people dedicate their lives to studying cave art, Shakespearean plays, and so much more.
</p>
<p>When we take the time to dive into art created in the past, we can learn about other generations and eras. We can study art to find out what those before us were facing and how they overcame it. In the same way, future generations will learn about our current events through the art we leave behind.
</p>

<li><b> Art leads to healthy and thoughtful cultural discussions</li></b>
<p>Art is often controversial or groundbreaking. And when art creates a stir, it has the potential to spark healthy conversations that lead to improvements across a society. Rather than impassioned debate, art gives us an opportunity to analyze, respond to, and create social change.
</p>
<li><b> It gives us a place to gather as a society</li></b>
<p>Beyond personal development, the overall social impact of the arts is essential to understand. Cultures big and small unite through the arts to build better communities.
</p>
<p>From fine art showings to community theatre in the park, the arts provide an opportunity to gather with other people from all walks of life. Several case studies have actually demonstrated that art in rural communities specifically can help boost economic growth. Further, it strengthens the bonds between people in these places.</p>
